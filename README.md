How to read?

 Points on Graph represents -> Emotions which I had during Actions(X-Axis) correspodning to my Mood from 0-10 on a Moodline (Y-Axis),
 for Instance, at 7:00, I felt Tired, During Morning and Overall Mood is 5.
 P.S New Feauture -> click on each dot on a graph, so Information above will appear.
 
 Idea
 
The idea for this project — 100 observations of my emotions, came from combining two things:
something I experience every day (my emotions and habits) and a desire to understand myself better through visualisation.
For example, I often wake up late after long nights gaming, so that pattern naturally appeared in the data.
The dataset consists of 100+ observations collected manually over several weeks, each entry including:
Date, Time (hourly), Emotion, Activity, Overall mood (rated 1–10), Notes.
All process of topic thinking I made at Notion page, which you can be familiar with here 
(Sorry for poor formatting, thinking process tends to be messy):

 Creative Approach
 
Inspired by Dear Data Week 11: Emotions, I decided to mix both:
Color-based emotional mapping (each emotion or activity has its own representation).
Time distribution — aligning emotions along the time of day.
Mood wavelength — a simple line connecting emotions, representing overall daily mood (1–10 scale).
The goal is to turn everyday feelings into a readable visual pattern, balancing data and design.

AI Usage

It would be dishonest to say  I didn't use AI help in this project. While Processing reference (https://processing.org/reference/) became my second home, I also used AI for code reviews (feedback without code), debugging suggestions, and structuring my overall project vision.
 All the core code, design, and other decisions were made by me. 
 No AI-generated code was used in final version of the project.
