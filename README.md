 How to read?

 This Processing sketch visualises 100 mood observations in the style of Dear Data.
Each point on the graph represents an emotion felt during a specific action (X-axis) and its corresponding mood value from 0–10 (Y-axis).
How to read the graph:
The X-axis shows actions or moments throughout the day.
The Y-axis shows mood level (0 = very low, 10 = very high).
Each dot is an emotion experienced at that time/action.
Example: at 07:00 I felt Tired during the morning routine, with an overall mood value of 5.
You can click any dot to display its detailed explanation.

How to interact with the sketch:

 - Start the project (default size: 1100×900, adjustable).
 - The daily graph will appear. Press Space to toggle the “How to Read” panel.
 - Switch between days by clicking the menu buttons or using the Up/Down arrow keys.
 - Click any point on the graph to view its emotion and description.
 - After viewing all days, open Statistics to see both daily and overall summaries.
 
 
 Idea
 
The idea for this project — 100 observations of my emotions, came from combining two things:
something I experience every day (my emotions and habits) and a desire to understand myself better through visualisation.
For example, I often wake up late after long nights gaming, so that pattern naturally appeared in the data.
The dataset consists of 100+ observations collected manually over several weeks, each entry including:
Date, Time (hourly), Emotion, Activity, Overall mood (rated 1–10), Notes.
All process of topic thinking I made at Notion page, which you can be familiar with here

 Creative Approach
 
Inspired by Dear Data Week 11: Emotions, I decided to mix both:
Color-based emotional mapping (each emotion or activity has its own representation).
Time distribution — aligning emotions along the time of day.
Mood wavelength — a simple line connecting emotions, representing overall daily mood (1–10 scale).
The goal is to turn everyday feelings into a readable visual pattern, balancing data and design.

AI Usage

It would be dishonest to say  I didn't use AI help in this project. While Processing reference (https://processing.org/reference/) became my second home, I also used AI for code reviews (feedback without code), debugging suggestions, and structuring my overall project vision.
 All the core code, design, and other decisions were made by me. 
 No AI-generated code was used in final version of the project.
